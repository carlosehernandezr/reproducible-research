## The Goal

The basic goal of this project is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some basic questions about severe weather events.

## Introduction

Storms and other severe weather events can cause economic and public health problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes as much as possible is a key concern.

That is why we believe that itâ€™s of great importance to know which of these events are that cause the greatest economic and health damage in the communities.

So in this data analysis we will focus on answering the following two questions:

 1. Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health?

 2. Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences?

To answer these questions we will explore the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks the characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of deaths, injuries, and property damage.
